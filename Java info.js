/*Java.IO is standard for Java Input/Output. So in essence you're importing extra Input/Output functionality. 
The asterisk on the end means you're importing everything in the Java.IO Package.



The java.util.Scanner class is one of the first components that new Java developers encounter. To use it in your code, you should import it, although another option is to explicitly reference the package in your code.
java scanner import

There are multiple ways to import the Java Scanner class into your code.

Java’s Scanner class makes it easy to get input from the user, which allows simple programs to quickly become interactive. And a little bit of interactivity always makes learning how to program a computer just a little bit more fun.

However, there is one minor complexity the Java Scanner class add into the software development mix.

In order to use the Java Scanner class in your code, you must either fully reference the java.util package when you call the Scanner, or you must add a Java Scanner import statement at the start of your class.

To keep your code readable and less verbose, a Java Scanner import is recommended.

When you add an import statement to your code, you are telling the Java compiler that you need access to a class that isn’t accessible by default. The java.util.Scanner import statement at the top of many Java classes means that somewhere in the code, the Scanner class is being used.
