      A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers
      that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand
      for content delivery network or content distribution network. Can get all
      stuff in html like here with document.all; example let val; val =
      document.all; /////// other things as well do this in app.js or whatever.
      val = document.URL; val = document.contentType; and so on lots of options
      To get all forms on the page do val = document.forms; console.log(val);
      val = document.forms[0].id; other things as well val =
      document.scripts[2].getattribute('src'); gives him app.js in his case
      foreach() is for arrays only can turn into an array by: let scripts =
      document.scripts; let scriptsArr = Array.from(scripts);
      scriptsArr.forEach(function(script) { console.log(script); }); loops
      through and gives you each script tag
