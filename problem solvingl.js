Separate ideation from evaluation. When you brainstorm creative ideas, have a separate time for writing it all down. Focus on generating lots of ideas. 
Don't prioritize or evaluate them until everything is captured.
Judging will shut it down. Nothing stops the flow of creative ideas faster than judging them on the spot. Wait until the brainstorming is over before you evaluate.
Restate problems as questions. It's easier to entice a group into thinking of creative ideas when challenges are stated as open-ended questions.
Use "Yes and" to expand ideas. Here's one of the basic tenets of improv comedy. 
It's way too easy to shut down and negate ideas by using the word "but" (i.e. "But I think this is better...").
 Avoid this at all costs. 
 Instead, expand on what was previously introduced by saying "Yes, and..." to keep ideas flowing and evolving.
