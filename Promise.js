/*
In React, there are various ways to work with asynchronous data, but using Promises is one of the most popular ones.
 A Promise is an object that represents an asynchronous operation. 
 It stands for a value that will be resolved in the future, in other words.

 When we make a promise in React Native, it will be executed when the execution time comes, or it will be rejected. 
 A promise is used to handle the asynchronous output of an executed operation.
  With promises, we can execute a code block until a non-block async request is complete.
