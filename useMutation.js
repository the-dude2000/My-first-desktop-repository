In a summary React Query useMutation hook is a powerful tool for managing asynchronous data in your React applications.
 It makes it easy to perform mutations and automatically update your UI with the results, 
 without having to worry about managing the details of fetching, caching, and updating data.

 useMutation will track the state of a mutation, just like useQuery does for queries. 
 It'll give you loading , error and status fields to make it easy for you to display what's going on to your users.
